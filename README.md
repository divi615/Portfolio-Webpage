# DESCRIPTION OF THE TASK

My personal portfolio website is a responsive, single-page application built using HTML and CSS to showcase my skills, interests, and projects as a web developer and someone deeply engaged in learning data analytics. The site features a clean, modern dark theme with smooth navigation that links to different sections including an introduction, project highlights, and a contact form. In the "About Me" section, I introduce myself as a passionate developer who is currently engaged with learning new technologies and applying them to real-world problems. I have a strong interest in web development and data analytics, and I enjoy staying updated with the latest tech trends and continuously improving my skills. The "Projects" section highlights some of my key work, including a project on analyzing marketing campaigns, which reflects my growing expertise in data-focused problem solving. Each project is presented in a clean, easy-to-read layout using well-styled cards for better visual impact. In the "Contact" section, I’ve included a form that allows visitors to reach out directly. While the form is currently static, it's structured to be easily connected with a backend service in the future. The overall design is fully responsive, making sure it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. I’ve used modern CSS features like box shadows, hover effects, and rounded corners to give the site a polished and professional feel. This portfolio is not just a technical showcase, but also a personal platform where I can introduce myself to the world, share my journey, and connect with others. I'm excited to continue building on this, adding more interactivity and content as I grow in my career.
